## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms form the foundation of computer science and are crucial for writing efficient and optimized code. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of 450 DSA problems that cover a wide range of topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.

Each problem in this repository is accompanied by a detailed explanation, approach, and a Java implementation. By solving these problems, you can gain hands-on experience in implementing various data structures and algorithms, as well as improve your problem-solving skills.

## Prerequisites

To run the Java code in this repository, you need to have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have Java JDK installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Oracle website or use a package manager specific to your operating system.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): It is recommended to use an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans for a smooth coding experience. However, you can also compile and run the Java code using command-line tools.

## Usage

   git clone https://github.com/kshitizprakash09/450-DSA-questions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
4. Browse the folders to find the specific problem you want to explore.
5. Each problem is contained in its own folder and includes the problem statement, explanation, approach, and Java implementation.
6. Read the problem statement and examine the provided code to understand the solution.
7. Modify the code as needed or use it as a reference to implement your own solution.
8. Compile and run the Java code using your IDE or command-line tools.

## Problem Structure

Each problem folder follows a similar structure:

- **Problem Statement**: A file that describes the problem and its requirements.
- **Explanation**: A detailed explanation of the problem, along with examples and any additional information.
- **Approach**: A description of the approach or algorithm used to solve the problem.
